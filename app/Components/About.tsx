                        I love coding in Typescript and C#, and have worked with frameworks
                        like ReactJS, VueJS and ExpressJS. I currently use .NET Framework, NextJS, NuxtJS, and NodeJS in a lot of my projects.

                        My hobbies are weight trainning or calisthenics. I like to playing sports such as football and basketball.
